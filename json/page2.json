Concorde class offers expedited data\n        delivery.  One major benefit to using Avian Carriers is that this is\n        the only networking technology that earns frequent flyer miles, plus\n        the Concorde and First classes of service earn 50% bonus miles per\n        packet.  Ostriches are an alternate carrier that have much greater\n        bulk transfer capability but provide slower delivery, and require the\n        use of bridges between domains.</p>\n        <p>The service level is indicated on a per-carrier basis by bar-code\n        markings on the wing.  One implementation strategy is for a bar-code\n        reader to scan each carrier as it enters the router and then enqueue\n        it in the proper queue, gated to prevent exit until the proper time.\n        The carriers may sleep while enqueued.</p>\n        <p>For secure networks, carriers may have classes Prime or Choice.\n        Prime carriers are self-keying when using public key encryption.\n        Some distributors have been known to falsely classify Choice carriers\n        as Prime.</p>\n        <p>Packets MAY be marked for deletion using RED paint while enqueued.</p>\n        <p>Weighted fair queueing (WFQ) MAY be implemented using scales, as\n        shown:</p>\n        <pre>                                                  __\n                                  _____/-----\\   / o\\\n                                 <____   _____\\_/    >--\n                 +-----+              \\ /    /______/\n                 | 10g |               /|:||/\n                 +-----+              /____/|\n                 | 10g |                    |\n                 +-----+          ..

When carrying web traffic, the carriers may\n        digest the spiders, leaving behind a more compact representation.\n        The carriers may be confused by mirrors.</p>\n        <p>Round-robin queueing is not recommended.  Robins make for well-tuned\n        networks but do not support the necessary auto-homing feature.</p>\n        <p>A BOF was held at the last IETF but only Avian Carriers were allowed\n        entry, so we don't know the results other than we're sure they think\n        MPLS is great.  Our attempts at attaching labels to the carriers have\n        been met with resistance.</p>\n        <p>NATs are not recommended either -- as with many protocols, modifying\n        the brain-embedded IP addresses is difficult, plus Avian Carriers MAY\n        eat the NATs.</p>\n        <p>Encapsulation may be done with saran wrappers.  Unintentional\n        encapsulation in hawks has been known to occur, with decapsulation\n        being messy and the packets mangled.</p>\n        <p>Loose source routes are a viable evolutionary alternative enhanced\n        standards-based MSWindows-compliant technology, but strict source\n        routes MUST NOT be used, as they are a choke-point.</p>\n        <p>The ITU has offered the IETF formal alignment with its corresponding\n        technology, Penguins, but that won't fly.</p>\n        <p>Multicasting is supported, but requires the implementation of a clone\n        device.  Carriers may be lost if they are based on a tree as it is\n        being pruned.  The carriers propagate via an inheritance tree.  The\n        carriers have an average TTL of 15 years, so their use in expanding\n        ring searches is limited.</p>\n        <p>Additional quality of service discussion can be found in a Michelin's\n        guide.</p>\n    </article>\n    <article>\n        <h3>MIB and Management issues</h3>\n        <p>AvCarrier2 OBJECT-TYPE\n            SYNTAX     SEQUENCE OF DNA\n            MAX-ACCESS can't-read\n            STATUS     living\n            DESCRIPTION \"Definition of an avian carrier\"\n            ::= { life eukaryotes mitochondrial_eukaryotes crown_eukaryotes\n                metazoa chordata craniata vertebrata gnathostomata\n                sarcopterygii terrestrial_vertebrates amniota diapsida\n                archosauromorpha archosauria dinosauria aves neornithes\n                columbiformes columbidae columba livia }</p>\n        <p>AvCarrier OBJECT-TYPE\n            SYNTAX     SET OF Cells\n            MAX-ACCESS not-accessible\n            STATUS     obsolete\n            DESCRIPTION \"Definition of an avian carrier\"\n            ::= { life animalia chordata vertebrata aves\n                columbiformes columbidae columba livia }</p>\n        <p>PulseRate OBJECT-TYPE\n            SYNTAX     Gauge(0..300)\n            MAX-ACCESS read-only\n            STATUS     current\n            DESCRIPTION \"Pulse rate of carrier, as measured in neck.\n                        Frequent sampling is disruptive to operations.\"\n            ::= { AvCarrier 1}</p>\n        <p>The carriers will not line up in lexigraphic order but will\n        naturally order in a large V shape.
